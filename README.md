# SMF-SCBF-dual-system
This repository contains full details of the seismic design procedure of the studied building archetypes along with the related files generated for this purpose.
"Design-Procedure.pdf" describes the way of using all the related files.
"Gusset-Plate-Design.tcl" contains a subroutine used to design the gusset plates using the method presented by Astaneh-Asl et al.
"Capacity-Limited-Analysis.m" contains a subroutine used to control the members of SCBFs for the seismic requirements of AISC 341-16.
It should be mentioned that the ETABS and OpenSees files of building archetypes will also be uploaded to the repository soon.
